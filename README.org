* NUMeric Minor Modes (nummm)
  Display the number of minor modes instead of their names in Emacs mode-line.

  This mode replaces the =minor-mode-alist= in =mode-line-modes= with
  a custom one. =minor-mode-alist= is NOT modified. Also, a backup of
  =mode-line-modes= is done when enabling =nummm-mode= and is
  restored when is turned off.
  The face can be changed customizing =nummm-face=.

* Usage
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'nummm-mode)
    (nummm-mode t)
  #+END_SRC
